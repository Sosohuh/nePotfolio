                <p>Mentioned on my cover, my name is Esona Gilikidi and situated in a local town known as<br> Khayelitsha. Describing myself I 
                    would say that I'm an active person who enjoys sports and traveling when <br>I'm going <br>out. Going out, I like to hike if 
                    time agrees on the side and as sport on the that hand, later you will notice my cv <br>and it'll also tell you that I'm into 
                    soccer and basketball. Between the 2, soccer prefer to follow up on it <br> and do read ups as for basketball I perticipate in it.</p>
            
                <p>As you can see, this is my personal website. I am currently am in a programme that offers leanership in <br><b>Website and
                    Application programming</b>. In that I would aslo describe myself as a person who can <br>adapt easy to dfferent situations, 
                    I love learning something new, especially if it benefit in education. During <br>my extra time, I read up on online articles, 
                    spend time catching up on my studies. Not only I am doing this<br> coding learnership but am continuing my studies at a 
                    collage located in Rondeboach and is known as <br>IIE Versity Collage</p>
                
                    
                <p>One thing I would admire myself about is the quick to adapt to different situations. Like mentioned earlier on, I am that guy 
                    who loves learning new things, skills, knowledge. So adaptation is much easy for me as I become eager to learn this. In terms 
                    of education, stated I am in an institution and there I am studying the world of finance. Future I wish to study <u>Accounting</u> 
                    archieveing qualifications for it, currently am doing a business management and accounting study to archieve my desired qualification. 
                    Reason for choosing that path, people around close to me made me realise how good I can be towards money. 
                    In the coding department, I learned it because I always had a want to learn something; a portion in the <i>'IT'</i> feild. The bootcamp 
                    was an opportunity knocking on my door so I decided to go for it, which that in the end woke a passion in my I never 
                    thought I had <u>Coding</u>. Now here I am doing my porfolio, show casing the skill I recently learned during my time 
                    in the bootcamp.</p>
